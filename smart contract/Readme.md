# Aptos Deployment

This folder contains smart contracts and deployment configurations for the Aptos network.

## Overview

Aptos is a Layer 1 blockchain that uses the Move programming language, offering high throughput and strong security guarantees through its parallel execution engine.

## Structure

- `contracts/` - Smart contract source files written in Move
- `scripts/` - Deployment and interaction scripts
- `tests/` - Contract test files

## Deployment

The smart contracts in this folder are specifically configured for deployment on the Aptos network. Make sure to use the correct Aptos network endpoints:

- Aptos Mainnet
- Aptos Testnet
- Aptos Devnet

## Notes

- Always test deployments on Aptos testnet/devnet before deploying to mainnet
- Ensure proper configuration of Move modules
- Keep track of deployed module addresses for future reference
- Familiarize yourself with Move's resource-oriented programming model
