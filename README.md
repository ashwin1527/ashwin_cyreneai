# CyreneAI — Distributed Digital System Framework

CyreneAI enables users to create and operate persistent, autonomous digital systems by using a global network of contributor-run devices. It removes the need for centralized cloud services and reduces hosting costs by over 70%.

##  NetSepio Node Infrastructure

CyreneAI is powered by **NetSepio's Erebrus Node Network**, a permissionless compute and bandwidth layer contributed by individual users.

### What It Does

- Users install lightweight software on their devices to share **compute and bandwidth**.
- These nodes become part of the **CyreneAI execution mesh**, enabling smart systems to run across distributed resources.
- This infrastructure replaces traditional hosting and enables **cost-effective, censorship-resistant deployments**.

### 🖥 How to Run a Node

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetSepio/erebrus/node_installer/install-node.sh)
```
### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Follow the on-screen prompts to install dependencies.  
2. You’ll be guided through a configuration process.  
3. Set parameters like machine name, location, and contribution limits.  
4. Once configured, your machine will start participating in the **Erebrus compute network**.



### CyreneAI Framework

The **CyreneAI Framework** enables users to deploy and manage AI agent across the Erebrus node network.

### Core Capabilities

- Deploys logic to distributed nodes instead of cloud servers.
- Uses a protocol called **Hyper-Coherent Network (HCN)** for:
  - System coordination  
  - Context sharing  
  - Self-replication (no single point of failure)

### Key Benefits

- **Reduces hosting cost by 70%**
- **No dependency on centralized providers**
- **Persistent and private execution**
